#  YouTube Dislike Counter

This project is a browser extension that reshows the number of dislikes a YouTube video has. The backend fetches the number of dislikes a YouTube video has, stores it in a database and everytime the dislike button is pressed the counter is updated.

The YouTube video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qveWEhfUCmE).
